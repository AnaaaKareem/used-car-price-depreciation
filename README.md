# Used Car Price Depreciation Analysis

## Business Understanding

### What is the problem?

Due to the uncertainty of vehicle valuation, Dealership and second-hand car platform often face a prominent financial risk when pricing used vehicles for trade-ins and resale, as the traditional method of valuing often relies on static "book values" or subjective experience (human intuition) rather than data-driven insights, which fails to account for dynamic market factors and complex non-linear relationships between variables.

#### Current challenges

- Diminishing profit margin due to over payment on Trade-in acquisition
- Overpriced vehicle leading to market stagnation as vehicles sit in inventories unsold beyond the turnover periods
- A lack of a standardized methodology accounting for the vehicle’s history leading to inconsistencies in evaluating the vehicles price
- Missed revenue opportunities from the inability to identify which vehicle types and brands retain value best
- Not accounting for the vehicles health condition during the pricing meaning reconditioning costs wipe out guaranteed margins when trade-in prices are set before mechanical inspection
- Multiple factors influence the pricing policy for used cars such as mileage, age, type (ICE or EV).
- Dealerships cannot reliably predict resale prices needed to maintain target profit margins
- Profit margins are difficult for car dealership to maintain as they cannot predict resale prices
- No clear evidence on whether electric vehicles depreciate differently than petrol vehicles
- Limited data in electric vehicles depreciation compared to internal combustion engine
- Electric Vehicle’s state of health are difficult to predict unlike ICE’s odometer which is visible resulting in losses in trading.
- Governments constantly subsidies electric vehicles using grants or tax credits giving a shock in the market resulting in sudden crashes overnight.

#### Valuation Gap

There is no robust predictive model that enables dealerships to input a vehicle's characteristics (mileage, year, brand, fuel type) and receive an accurate resale price prediction with confidence intervals meaning a dealership could offers too little for the vehicle and lose the trade-in customer to a competitor or they offer too much and erode their profit margin or incur a loss upon resale.

#### Market Complexity

Historical depreciation for Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles tend to follow a smoother depreciation curve that may not apply to EVs (due to battery degradation fears, tax incentives, or rapid tech obsolescence) due to ICE having a manufacturing warranty rather than EVs in which battery failure falls in the owner. These factors must be taken in mind due to the shift from ICE to EV in the automotive industry.

#### Brand Variety

Depreciation differs as premium and economy brands lose value at different rates. Treating them with the same depreciation model leads to pricing inefficiencies.
